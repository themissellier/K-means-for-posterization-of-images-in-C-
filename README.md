# K-means-for-posterization-of-images-in-C-
This project posterizes a PPM image by reducing its color palette to a user-defined number of levels. It uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar colors and replace them with their mean values, creating a simplified image while preserving the main color tones.
